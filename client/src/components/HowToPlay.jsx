                from multiple teams.
            </p>
            <u>Editing Entries</u>
            <p>
                All entries are final once entered. Entries cannot be edited or
                canceled for any reason
            </p>

            <p>All stats in overtime are scored for entries</p>
            <u>Player Does Not Play</u>
            <p>
                Regardless of active or inactive if a player plays 0 minutes,
                entries that include that player will be considered inactive and
                considered a push
            </p>
            <u>Player/Stat Availability</u>
            <p>
                Underline reserves the right to add, edit or remove players from
                the lobby at any time, for any reasons. Over/Under predictions
                can and will change throughout the week. However, once an entry
                is submitted that stat line is locked for that entry.
            </p>
            <u>Stat Corrections</u>
            <p>
                Underline leverages official league statistics provided by
                reputable partners and only includes statistics from sporting
                events the relevant league deems to be official. We endeavor to
                promptly settle contests and distribute prizes, but it is also
                important to us to make sure we do so accurately. On a weekly
                basis, final scores will be confirmed within 72 hours after the
                final game for that week is played. Normally, any scoring
                changes or stat corrections provided by our partners after a
                contest has ended and Underline has settled the contest will not
                impact the already-settled contest. However, Underline reserves
                the right in its sole discretion to revise scores after they are
                released in the unlikely event of potential scoring error by a
                provider or Underline. In those circumstances, the contest
                results may be altered, and payments may be distributed or
                reversed based on the correction
            </p>
            <u>Suspended Games</u>
            <p>
                If a game is suspended or postponed and the completion of that
                game does not occur on the original scheduled calendar day,
                selections for the game will be graded as a push.
            </p>
            <u>Contest Cancellation</u>
            <p>
                Underline also reserves the right to cancel any contests, in our
                sole discretion, without any restrictions. If you have paid an
                entry fee for a Pick'em Contest and Underline cancels the
                contest, we will credit your account balance with the entry fee
                amount. Typically, we would only do so in cases where we believe
                that due to problems on our services or occurring in events
                impacting the sporting events, there would be questions
                regarding the integrity of the contest, or when we believe an
                entry is circumventing the rules
            </p>
            <u>Withdrawals</u>
            <p>
                Underline requires users to play through deposited funds at
                least 1x prior to requesting a payout if deposit occurred less
                than 72hrs ago. Bonus/Promo/Free to Pay Funds Promo funds are
                awarded for the sole purpose of placing entries. Promo funds
                cannot be withdrawn or combined with actual money. Underline
                reserves the right to cancel or modify promotions at any time.
