                Creator code is a free way for Underline users to support their
                favorite sports content creators while playing contests on
                Underline. Playerâ€™s declare their support by entering a creator
                code when submitting an entry.
            </p>

            <p>
                This support comes at no cost to users. Anytime a user wins a
                contest, Underline bonuses the creator chosen. The purpose of
                the program is to enable sports content creators to earn money
                by creating content for Underline.
            </p>

            <p>
                Underline believes sports content creators are an essential part
                of the sports ecosystem/community so we built this program to
                enable more sports content creators.
